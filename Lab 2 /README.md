# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open Datasets, and Drawing a Methodology Diagram.

## Description of the dataset:-
This Lab uses a dataset revolved around figuring out whether email messages are **spam** or **Not Spam**.
Each record represents one email, and the dataset is suitable for a supervised machine learning task.

## Machine Learning Problem:-
This is a **classification problem** because the target has two specific variables: Spam or not Spam.

## Overview:-
It's loaded and inspected using python and pandas. 
A methodology diagram is provided to explain the complete machine learning overflow. 

## Files in this repository:-
